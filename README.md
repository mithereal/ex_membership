Membership is a turnkey membership system and a toolkit for granular feature management systems.
It allows you to define features such as: [:can_edit, :can_delete] on a per module basis
each module has an ets backed registry with {function, permission} tuple.
this allows us to have plans and roles with multiple features which members can subscribe to
we then can hold each user in a registry and compare features on a function level.

Here is a small example:

```elixir
defmodule Post do
  use Membership, registry: :post
  
  alias Post 
  alias Membership.Repo 
  alias Membership.Member
  
   def create_post(id, member_id \\ 1) do
    member = Repo.get(Member, member_id)
    post = %Post{id: id}

    permissions(member) do
      has_plan(:editor)
    end

    as_authorized(member) do
      Repo.get(Post, id) |> Repo.insert_or_update()
    end

    # Notice that you can use both macros or functions

    case authorized? do
      :ok -> Repo.get(Post, id) |> Repo.delete()
      {:error, message} -> raise message
      _ -> raise "Member is not authorized"
    end
  end

  def delete_post(id, member_id \\ 1) do
    member = Repo.get(Member, member_id)
    member = load_and_authorize_member(member)
    post = %Post{id: id}

    permissions do
      has_plan(:admin) # or
      has_plan(:editor) # or
      has_feature(:delete_posts) # or
      has_feature(:delete, post) # Entity related features
      calculated(fn member ->
        Post.email_confirmed?(member)
      end)
    end

    as_authorized(member) do
      Repo.get(Post, id) |> Repo.delete()
    end

    # Notice that you can use both macros or functions

    case authorized? do
      :ok -> Repo.get(Post, id) |> Repo.delete()
      {:error, message} -> "Raise error"
      _ -> "Raise error"
    end
  end
  end

```

## Mix Tasks

To create the migrations in your elixir project run

```bash
mix membership.install
```

## Features

- [x] `Member` -> `[Feature]` permission schema
- [x] `Plan` -> `[Feature]` permission schema
- [x] `Role` -> `[Feature]` permission schema
- [x] `Member` -> `[Plan]` -> `[Feature]` permission schema
- [x] `Member` -> `[Role]` -> `[Feature]` permission schema
- [x] Computed permission in runtime
- [x] Easily readable DSL

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_membership, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

```elixir
# In your config/config.exs file

config :ex_membership,
  ecto_repos: [MyRepo],
  ecto_repo: MyRepo,
  primary_key_type: :uuid

config :ex_membership, MyRepo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  hostname: "localhost",
  database: "ex_membership",
  stacktrace: true,
  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,
  pool_size: 10,
  port: 55432
```

```elixir
iex> mix membership.setup
iex> mix membership.components
```

### Usage with ecto

Membership is originally designed to be used with Ecto. Usually you will want to have your own table
for `Accounts`/`Users` living in your application. To do so you can link member with `belongs_to` association within
your schema.

```elixir
# In your migrations add member_id field
defmodule Sample.Migrations.CreateUsersTable do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:users) do
      add :username, :string
      add :member_id, references(Membership.Member.table())

      timestamps()
    end

    create unique_index(:users, [:username])
  end
end

```

This will allow you link any internal entity with 1-1 association to members. Please note that you need to create member
on each user creation (e.g with `Membership.Member.changeset/2`) and call `put_assoc` inside your changeset

```elixir
# In schema defintion
defmodule Sample.User do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "users" do
    field :username, :String

    belongs_to :member, Membership.Member

    timestamps()
  end
end
```

```elixir
# In your model
defmodule Sample.Post do
  use Membership, registry: :post

  def delete_post(id, member_id) do
    user = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, member_id)
    load_and_authorize_member(user)
    # Function allows multiple signatues of member it can
    # be either:
    #  * %Membership.Member{}
    #  * %AnyStruct{member: %Membership.Member{}}
    #  * %AnyStruct{member_id: id} (this will perform database preload)


    permissions do
      has_plan(:admin) # or
      has_plan(:editor) # or
      has_feature(:delete_posts) # or
    end

    member_authorized do
      Sample.Repo.get(Sample.Post, id) |> Sample.repo.delete()
    end

    # Notice that you can use both macros or functions

    case authorized? do
      :ok -> Sample.Repo.get(Sample.Post, id) |> Sample.repo.delete()
      {:error, message} -> raise message
      _ -> raise "Member is not authorized"
    end
  end
  end

```

Membership tries to infer the member, so it is easy to pass any struct (could be for example `User` in your application)
which has set up `belongs_to` association for member. If the member was already preloaded from database Membership will
take it as loaded member. If you didn't do preload and just loaded `User` -> `Repo.get(User, 1)` Membership will fetch
the member on each authorization try.

### Calculated permissions

Often you will come to case when `static` permissions are not enough. For example allow only users who confirmed their
email address.

```elixir
defmodule Sample.Post do
 use Membership, registry: :post
 
  def create(id \\ 1) do
    member = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, id)
    load_and_authorize_member(member)

    permissions(member) do
          calculated(
        member,
        fn member ->
          Post.confirmed_email(member)
        end,
        :create_calculated
      )
    end
    end
    end
```

We can also use DSL form of `calculated` keyword

```elixir
defmodule Sample.Post do
 use Membership, registry: :post
 
  def create(id \\ 1) do
    member = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, id)
    load_and_authorize_member(member)
 
      permissions(member) do
          calculated(
        member,
        :confirmed_email,
        :create_calculated
      )
    end


  def confirmed_email(member) do
    member.email_confirmed?
  end
end
end
```

### Composing calculations

When we need to member calculation based on external data we can invoke bindings to `calculated/2`

```elixir
defmodule Sample.Post do
 use Membership, registry: :post
 
  def create(id \\ 1) do
    member = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, id)
    load_and_authorize_member(member)
    post = %Post{owner_id: member.id}

    permissions(member) do
      calculated(member,:confirmed_email)
      calculated(member, :is_owner, [post])
    end
  end

  def confirmed_email(member) do
    member.email_confirmed?
  end

  def is_owner(member, [post]) do
    member.id == post.owner_id
  end
end
```

To perform exclusive features such as `when User is owner of post AND is in editor plan` we can do so as in following
example

```elixir
defmodule Sample.Post do
 use Membership, registry: :post
 
  def create(member_id \\ 1) do
    member = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, member_id)
    load_and_authorize_member(member)
    post = %Post{owner_id: member.id}

    permissions do
      has_plan(:editor)
    end

    member_authorized do
      case is_owner(member, post) do
        :ok -> {:ok, "Member is the Owner of Post"}
        {:error, message} -> {:error, message}
      end
    end
  end

  def is_owner(member, post) do
    load_and_authorize_member(member)

    permissions do
      calculated(fn p, [post] ->
        p.id == post.owner_id
      end)
    end

    authorized?
  end
end
```

We can simplify example in this case by excluding DSL for permissions

```elixir
defmodule Sample.Post do
 use Membership, registry: :post
 
  def create(id \\ 1 , member_id \\ 1) do
    member = Sample.Repo.get(Sample.User, member_id)
    load_and_authorize_member(member)
    post = %Post{owner_id: member.id}

    # We can also use has_feature?/2
    if has_plan?(member, :admin) and is_owner(member, post) do
      {:ok, "Member Can Modify Post"}
    end
  end

  def is_owner(member, post) do
    member.id == post.owner_id
  end
end
```

### Member related features

### Granting features

Let's assume we want to create new `Plan` - _gold_ which is able to delete accounts inside our system. We want to have
special `Member` who is given this _plan_ but also he is able to have `Feature` for banning users.

1. Create member

```elixir
iex> {:ok, member} = %Membership.Member{} |> Membership.Repo.insert()
```

2. Create some features

```elixir
iex> {:ok, feature_delete} = Membership.Feature.build("delete_accounts", "Delete accounts of users") |> Membership.Repo.insert()
iex> {:ok, feature_ban} = Membership.Feature.build("ban_accounts", "Ban users") |> Membership.Repo.insert()
```

3. Create plan

```elixir
iex> {:ok, plan} = Membership.Plan.build("gold", [], "Gold Package") |> Membership.Repo.insert()
```

4. Grant features to a plan

```elixir
iex> Membership.Plan.grant(plan, feature_delete)
```

5. Grant plan to a member

```elixir
iex> Membership.Member.grant(member, plan)
```

6. Grant features to a member

```elixir
iex> Membership.Member.grant(member, feature_ban)
```

```elixir
iex> member |> Membership.Repo.preload([:plan_memberships, :extra_features])
%Membership.Member{
features: ["ban_accounts"],
identifier: "asfdcxfdsr42424eq2",
  plan_memberships: [
    %Membership.Plan{
      identifier: "gold"
      features: ["delete_accounts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Revoking features

Same as we can grant any features to models we can also revoke them.

```elixir
iex> Membership.Member.revoke(member, plan)
iex> member |> Membership.Repo.preload([:plan_memberships, :extra_features])
%Membership.Member{
features: [],
identifier: "asfdcxfdsr42424eq2",
  plan_memberships: []
}
iex> Membership.Member.revoke(member, feature_ban)
iex> member |> Membership.Repo.preload([:plan_memberships, :extra_features])
%Membership.Member{
features: [],
identifier: "asfdcxfdsr42424eq2",
  plan_memberships: []
}
```
